## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/locals.git
   cd locals
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in the required environment variables in `.env.local`

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
